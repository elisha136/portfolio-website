## Overview

The Tarot T18 project focuses on developing a robust octocopter platform capable of autonomous water sampling operations in fjord environments. This heavy-lift drone is designed to replace GPS with Pozyx UWB for precise indoor/GPS-denied positioning.

## Problem Statement

Traditional water sampling in Norwegian fjords requires boats and significant logistics. An autonomous aerial platform can:
- Reduce sampling time from hours to minutes
- Access difficult-to-reach locations
- Provide repeatable, georeferenced sampling points

## System Architecture

The system consists of several integrated components working together:

### Hardware Components

| Component | Specification | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Frame | Tarot T18 Octocopter | Heavy-lift platform |
| Flight Controller | Pixhawk 4 | Flight management |
| Companion Computer | Jetson Orin Nano | Mission logic & sensors |
| Positioning | Pozyx UWB | GPS-denied navigation |
| Pump | Peristaltic pump | Water sample collection |

### Software Stack

- **ROS2 Humble** - Robot Operating System for inter-process communication
- **PX4 Autopilot** - Flight control firmware
- **MAVLink** - Drone communication protocol
- **Python 3.10** - Mission logic and sensor integration

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: GPIO Voltage Issues

**Problem**: Jetson Orin Nano GPIO pins outputting 0V instead of expected 3.3V

**Solution**: Configured pinmux using Jetson-IO tool to properly enable GPIO functionality

**Outcome**: Achieved reliable 3.3V output for pump control circuitry

### Challenge 2: Indoor Positioning

**Problem**: GPS unavailable in indoor test environments

**Solution**: Integrating Pozyx UWB system with Pixhawk via MAVLink position messages

**Status**: Currently configuring tag-anchor communication protocols

## Current Progress

- [x] Frame assembly and motor mounting
- [x] Flight controller configuration
- [x] Jetson Orin Nano integration
- [x] Basic MAVLink communication
- [ ] Pozyx UWB positioning (in progress)
- [ ] Peristaltic pump control system
- [ ] Autonomous mission planning
- [ ] Field testing

## Next Steps

1. Complete Pozyx UWB configuration and calibration
2. Integrate pump control via MAVLink auxiliary commands
3. Develop autonomous sampling mission logic in ROS2
4. Conduct indoor flight tests at IIR Lab
5. Plan outdoor field testing at fjord location
