## Overview

This AIS4003 Fundamentals of Automation and Mechatronics Engineering portfolio demonstrates foundational skills across the core disciplines of mechatronics: electronics design, mechanical engineering, control systems, industrial automation, and programming.

The portfolio is divided into three main modules with both individual and group work.

## Module I: Mechatronics (Electronics Design)

### PCB Design - NE555 Audio Generator

Designed and manufactured a printed circuit board featuring the NE555 timer IC in astable mode for audio signal generation. The circuit includes:

- **NE555 Timer IC** - Configured as astable oscillator
- **L7809CV Voltage Regulator** - 9V regulated output
- **470kΩ Potentiometer** - Frequency adjustment
- **Audio Output** - 3.5mm stereo jack and miniature speaker

| Component | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| NE555P | Timer IC | Square wave generation |
| L7809CV | Regulator | 9V supply regulation |
| Capacitors | 100µF, 100nF, 10nF | Filtering and timing |
| Potentiometer | 470kΩ | Frequency control |
| Resistors | 500Ω, 3kΩ, 4.7kΩ, 10kΩ, 15kΩ | Bias and current limiting |

The design was created in Autodesk Fusion 360, with Gerber and drill files generated for PCB manufacturing. The board was then soldered and tested successfully.

## Module II: Mechanical Engineering

### Robot Arm Design Project

Complete pick-and-place robot arm design including:

- **DH Parameter Tables** - Forward kinematics modeling
- **Inverse Kinematics** - Position to joint angle conversion
- **Torque Calculations** - Motor sizing for each joint
- **Deflection Analysis** - Cantilever beam calculations
- **Servo Selection** - eRob 80T and 90T servos chosen

Key specifications calculated:
- Link lengths: L1 = L2 = 400mm
- Workspace: 400mm × 500mm
- Joint 1 Torque: 116.56 Nm
- Joint 2 Torque: 87.44 Nm
- Total deflection: 0.2mm (within tolerance)

### Mechanical Engineering Exercises

- Stress and strain calculations for robot arm components
- Mass moment of inertia calculations
- Gear ratio optimization for servo motors
- Encoder resolution requirements

## Module III: Automation and Computer Science

### Control Systems Analysis

Derived transfer functions for DC motor model:

The differential equation for the motor system:
$$J\dot{\omega}_m(t) = -\left(D_m + \frac{K_t K_b}{R_a}\right)\omega_m(t) + \frac{K_t}{R_a}e_a(t)$$

Applied Laplace transform to obtain transfer function relating armature voltage to angular velocity.

### PLC Programming Portfolio

Industrial control systems exercises covering:
- Ladder logic programming
- Sequential function charts
- Industrial automation scenarios

### Python Data Analysis

Weather data analysis using Python with pandas:
- Temperature analysis from Vigra weather station
- Rainfall data processing and visualization
- Wind speed statistics and plotting

```python
# Sample code structure
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and process weather data
df = pd.read_csv('Temperature_vigra.csv')
# Analysis and visualization...
```
