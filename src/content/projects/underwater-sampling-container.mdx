## Overview

This MMA4002 Design for Automated Manufacturing group project developed a 3D-printed underwater sampling container system for ROV-based marine research. The containers are designed to collect seabed sediments, water samples, minerals, and marine organisms at various ocean depths.

The project applied Industry 4.0/5.0 principles, Design for Automated Assembly (DFAA), Lean Manufacturing concepts, and Product Architecture strategies.

## Problem Statement

Traditional underwater sampling containers lack customization and are expensive to manufacture. Our solution offers:

- **Scalability** - Multiple sizes for different sampling needs
- **Modularity** - Interchangeable clips and bracket systems
- **Automation** - Robot-friendly assembly design
- **Cost-effectiveness** - 3D printed components

## Design Concept

![Underwater sampling concept](/images/projects/underwater-concept.jpg)

The system consists of:
- **Containers** - Three sizes (small, medium, large) with varying wall thickness for depth rating
- **Lid Mechanism** - Twist-open design with integrated sealing
- **Clip Variants** - Magnet, twist, and slide mechanisms
- **Universal Bracket** - Mounts to ROV or diving equipment

## Technical Specifications

### Material Selection

| Material | Properties | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| PETG | Water resistant, durable, easy to print | Container bodies |
| TPU | Flexible, watertight | Sealing gaskets |

### Pressure Calculations

Wall thickness calculated using thin-wall pressure vessel formula:

$$t = \frac{P \cdot D}{2 \cdot S \cdot E}$$

Where:
- P = Hydrostatic pressure at depth
- D = Container diameter
- S = Material tensile strength (PETG: ~50 MPa)
- E = Safety factor

### Product Architecture

Implemented **Slot Architecture** allowing:
- Three container sizes sharing common clip interface
- Three clip variants (magnet, twist, slide)
- Universal bracket fits all containers

## DFAA Evaluation

Design for Automated Assembly principles applied:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Reduce parts | Minimized to essential components |
| Base object | Bracket serves as assembly base |
| Assembly directions | Top-down Z-axis assembly |
| Self-aligning features | Chamfers and guides for robot grippers |
| Unique orientation | Asymmetric features prevent misassembly |

## Manufacturing Workflow

1. **Design Phase** - CAD modeling with customer specifications
2. **Material Selection** - Based on depth requirements
3. **3D Printing** - Automated FDM printing with PETG
4. **Quality Control** - Dimensional inspection
5. **Robot Assembly** - Collaborative robot assembles components
6. **Final Inspection** - Seal integrity testing

## Collaborative Robot Assembly

The assembly process uses collaborative robots (cobots) at ManuLab:

Assembly sequence:
1. Pick bracket from feeder
2. Attach selected clip variant
3. Install container body
4. Quality verification

## Industry 4.0/5.0 Implementation

### Industry 4.0 Technologies Used
- **Additive Manufacturing** - 3D printing for customized production
- **Simulation** - CAD analysis before production
- **Autonomous Robots** - Cobot assembly

### Industry 5.0 Principles
- **Human-centricity** - Design considers diver/operator needs
- **Sustainability** - Minimal material waste, recyclable PETG
- **Resilience** - Modular design allows quick adaptation
